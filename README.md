* #### Run It
    Fire up the server using this one simple command:
    ```bash
        $ python manage.py runserver
    ```
    If your terminal doesn't recognize python for whatever reason use python3 instead
    ```bash
        $ python3 manage.py runserver
    ```
    You can now access the file api service on your browser by using
    ```
